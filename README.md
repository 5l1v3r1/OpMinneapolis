Greetings we are @AnonOpUSA and @YourAnonS0u1 
This is the guide to use this tool.. My gift to you :)

You would need Python 2.7+ you can get that in the links located below this text file..

Modules that you would need is BeautifulSoup... to do so 
In terminal type :

pip install BeautifulSoup 

if not then you would get the error message "you need to install: bs4"

next module that you would need is :

pip install requests

if not then you would get the error message "you need to install: requests"

last but not least the last module :

pip install socks

if not then you would get the error message "socks"

If you got all the modules then try to restart the tool.. command "python2 OpMinneapolis.py"
if you dont get any error then it has ran and you are ready to take shit offline <3
